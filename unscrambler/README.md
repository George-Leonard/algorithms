This is a small idea me and my friend had while playing the popular minecraft server, Arkham Network, in 2018.
Arkham network had an unscrambling challenge in the chat, and whoever solved this challenge first would be rewarded. Putting my coding skills to the test at the time, i decided
to see if i could make a python program, which (while running in the background of gameplay), could take the scrambled word from the minecraft chat, unscramble it, 
and instantly post it to our clipboard to paste within seconds. 
It turned out to be extremely successful. 
I did attempt to contact Arkham Network once we found this little 'cheat', and they have since removed the chat game.
