This code stemmed from an idea me and my friend had whilst revisiting the popular minecraft server 'Arkham Network' back in 2019.
Players on the 'Arkham Network' could earn rewards every so often, by being the first to unscramble randomly ordered letters into words; solving a maths problem or by reacting with a 'reaction word', quicker than anyone else on the server at the time.
This program could take the scrambled word from the minecraft chat, unscramble it, and instantly post it to our clipboard to paste to chat within seconds, earning us the rewards at an inhuman rate. It did the same thing with the maths problem and reaction word challenges.
It ran in the background of the game, and worked by constantly reading the chat logs, and waiting for the signature server message to appear, announcing the challenge.
It turned out to be extremely successful. I did attempt to contact Arkham Network once we found this little 'cheat', to prevent a disrupt in their economy, but they never got back to me.
